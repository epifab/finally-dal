# TYDAL

TYDAL (pronounced *tidal* `/ˈtʌɪd(ə)l/` and formerly YADL)
is a *type safe* PostgreSQL DSL for Scala.


## Getting started

### Installation

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

```
resolvers += "jitpack" at "https://jitpack.io"
```

Step 2. Add the dependency

```
libraryDependencies += "com.github.epifab" % "tydal" % "1.x-SNAPSHOT"	
```

### A basic example

```scala
import java.time.LocalDate
import java.util.UUID

import io.epifab.tydal._
import io.epifab.tydal.fields.{FieldDecoder, FieldEncoder}

import java.time.LocalDate
import java.util.UUID

case class Address(postcode: String, line1: String, line2: Option[String])

case class Student(
  id: UUID,
  name: String,
  email: Option[String],
  date_of_birth: LocalDate,
  address: Option[Address]
)

object Students extends TableBuilder["students", Student]

object Programme extends App {
  import io.circe.generic.auto._
  implicit val addressEncoder: FieldEncoder[Address] = FieldEncoder.jsonEncoder[Address]
  implicit val addressDecoder: FieldDecoder[Address] = FieldDecoder.jsonDecoder[Address]

  val connection = PostgresConnection(PostgresConfig.fromEnv())

  val createStudent =
    Insert
      .into(Students)
      .compile
      .withValues(Student(
        UUID.randomUUID,
        "Jack",
        Some("jack@tydal.io"),
        LocalDate.of(1970, 1, 1),
        Some(Address("7590", "Tydalsvegen 125", Some("Tydal, Norway")))
      ))

  val findStudents = 
    Select
      .from(Students as "s")
      .take(_("s").*)
      .where(ctx => ctx("s", "email") like "email" and (ctx("date_of_birth") < "max_dob"))
      .compile
      .withValues((
        "email" ~~> "%@tydal.io",
        "max_dob" ~~> LocalDate.of(1986, 1, 1)
      ))
      .mapTo[Student]
      .as[Vector]

  val program = (for {
    _ <- createStudent
    students <- findStudents
  } yield students).toIO(connection)

  program.unsafeRunSync()
}
```

### A not-so-basic example

**In English**

```
Find all students born between 1994 and 1998 who have taken at least one exam since 2010.
Also, find their best and most recent exam
```

**In SQL**

```sql
SELECT
    s.id             AS sid,
    s.name           AS sname,
    e.score          AS escore,
    e.exam_timestamp AS etime,
    c.name           AS cname
FROM students AS s
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT 
        e1.student_id AS sid,
        MAX(s1.score) AS score
    FROM exams AS e1
    Where e1.exam_timestamp > '2010-01-01T00:00:00Z'::timestamp
    GROUP BY e1.student_id
) AS se1
ON se1.student_id = s.id
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT
        e2.student_id          AS sid,
        e2.score               AS score
        MAX(e2.exam_timestamp) AS etime
    FROM exams AS e2
    GROUP BY e2.student_id, e2.score
) AS se2
ON se2.student_id = se1.student_id AND se2.score = se1.score
INNER JOIN exams AS e
ON e.student_id = se2.student_id AND e.exam_timestamp = se2.etime
INNER JOIN courses AS c
ON c.id = e.course_id
Where s.date_of_birth > '1994-01-01'::date AND s.date_of_birth < '1998-12-31'::date
ORDER BY escore DESC, sname ASC
```

**In Scala**

```scala
Select
  .from(Students as "s")
  .innerJoin(
    // max score per student
    Select
      .from(Exams as "e1")
      .take(ctx => (
        ctx("e1", "student_id") as "sid",
        Max(ctx("e1", "score")) as "score"
      ))
      .where(_("e1", "exam_timestamp") > "exam_min_date")
      .groupBy1(_("e1", "student_id"))
      .as("me1")
  )
  .on(_("sid") === _("s", "id"))
  .innerJoin(
    // select only the latest exam
    Select
      .from(Exams as "e2")
      .take(ctx => (
        ctx("e2", "student_id")          as "sid",
        ctx("e2", "score")               as "score",
        Max(ctx("e2", "exam_timestamp")) as "etime"
      ))
      .groupBy(ctx => (ctx("e2", "student_id"), ctx("e2", "score")))
      .as("me2")
  )
  .on((me2, ctx) => me2("sid") === ctx("me1", "sid") and (me2("score") === ctx("me1", "score")))
  .innerJoin(Exams as "e")
  .on((e, ctx) => e("exam_timestamp") === ctx("me2", "etime") and (e("student_id") === ctx("me2", "sid")))
  .innerJoin(Courses as "c")
  .on(_("id") === _("e", "course_id"))
  .take(ctx => (
    ctx("s", "id")             as "sid",
    ctx("s", "name")           as "sname",
    ctx("e", "score")          as "score",
    ctx("e", "exam_timestamp") as "etime",
    ctx("c", "name")           as "cname"
  ))
  .where(ctx => ctx("s", "date_of_birth") > "student_min_dob" and (ctx("s", "date_of_birth") < "student_max_dob"))
  .sortBy(ctx => Descending(ctx("score")) -> Ascending(ctx("sname")))
  .compile
  .withValues((
    "exam_min_date" ~~> Instant.parse("2010-01-01T00:00:00Z"),
    "student_min_dob" ~~> LocalDate.of(1994, 1, 1),
    "student_max_dob" ~~> LocalDate.of(1998, 12, 31)
  ))
```

## Why Tydal

This library has one job: bringing the compiler at your persistence layer service.  
The objective is to make it as difficult as possible to build a syntactically invalid query.

Typos:

```scala
Select.from(Students as "s").take(_("s", "asd"))
// Field or relation "asd" could not be found
```

Incompatible SQL types:

```scala
Select.from(Students as "s").where(_("s", "date_of_birth") === PlaceholderValue("1999"))
// Column[LocalDate] and PlaceholderValue[String] are not comparable

Select.from(Students as "s").where(_("s", "date_of_birth") in PlaceholderValue(Seq("1999", "1998")))
// Column[LocalDate] cannot be included in PlaceholderValue[Seq[String]]
```

Extract results to a non-matching target:

```scala
Select.from(Students as "s").take(_("s").*).mapTo[Exam]
// Could not find implicit for parameter generic ...
// ok, this last error message is not as specific as the ones above but it does the job
```

> *Warning*:  
> SQL is complex, and although Tydal helps protecting against several common mistakes you might make
it does not guarantee your query will run smoothly.


### Features

#### DBMS

The only supported DBMS is **PostgreSQL**.
I have no plan to extend this to support any other DBMS.


#### SQL language

SQL is huge, and Tydal covers only a handful of its features.
You might (or might not) find this DSL limiting for your use-case.
Most other libraries (Slick or Doobie for example) give you the alternative 
of writing plain text queries, but Tydal doesn't, because that would defeat the purpose of it.   

So, long story short, don't use it unless you're willing to contribute.


#### Types

Out of the box, the following field types are supported:

Database type               | Scala type
---                         | ---
`char`, `varchar`, `text`   | `String`
`int`                       | `Int`
`float`                     | `Double`
`date`, `timestamp`         | `LocalDate`, `Instant` (java.time)
`enum`                      | Any type `T`
`arrays`                    | `Seq[T]` where `T` is any of the above
`json`                      | Any type `T`

In addition, every data type can be made optional and encoded as `Option`.

The mapping between a SQL data type and its Scala representation is defined via two *type classes* named `FieldEncoder` and `FieldDecoder`.
You can, of course, define new encoders/decoders in order to support custom types.
